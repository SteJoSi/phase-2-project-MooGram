# Cosmo x Beauty

## Description 
**Cosmo x Beauty** is an interactive website that will allow my customers to purchase my favorite hair, skin, make-up, and bath products. The idea for this project came about because I am going on 6 years as being a hairdresser and I am not only passionate about all things hair care, but all beauty related items. I have gone through intense product knowledge training to allow me to tell clients what works, what doesn't work and why. I have gone through many trial and errors with hundreds of products and my clients have always trusted my input on products, so I thought I would create a website to include my favorite products.
